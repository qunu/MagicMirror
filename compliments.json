        "Sometimes the evil pixie that lives in my head suggests a joke that makes me laugh but I'm like \"Well this should stay internalised\". Then I say it anyway, because I'm an idiot, and you just give me a look like \"I'm going to pretend you didn't say that\". I appreciate that.",
        "I like to sing with you because I know that even though I can't sing, you'll join in anyway.",
        "You're awkward, but in a cute way. Like an elevator ride with a stranger, but the stranger is holding a box of kittens.",
        "I don't know who you think you are, but if you think it's someone sexy - then okay.",
        "If I were to take all the things I like about you and mix them in a blender the result would be a rasberry and vanilla milkshake. They're pretty awesome.",

        "I don't care if you don't know what you want to be, because right now you are already what I need.",
        "When I first met you, I was like, \"Oh, well, this person is going to be awesome\". And you were, and now we're friends. That's pretty neat.",
        "If I were a wizard I wouldn't turn you into Amy Pond, even though that would probably benefit the both of us, because I like you just the way you are.",
        "They say that if you love someone you should let them go. There was some more but I stopped listening. I'm never letting you go.",
        "I think it's safe to assume that you're the best person I know. That's not because I don't know many people, because I totally do.",
        "You know how when you do that thing? Yeah, I like that.",
        "Sometimes I look at you and I'm all \"Hello\" instead of \"Get lost\" - that's why you're special.",
        "I'm willing to put on proper clothes and leave my house to hang out with you. That's a rare and special accolade indeed.",
        "When you beat me in online games; I don't mind at all, the fun part was playing.",
        "Sometimes when I hang out with you I just think to myself \"This person is ridiculous.\" and that's why you're my best friend.",

        "You're not clumsy, you just happen to be really friendly with walls, floors and doors.",
        "I know I don't say \"I Love You\" enough, but if I said it everytime I felt it I'd never get anything done.",
        "Some people say you're weird, and that's pretty cool. Weird people are interesting, normal people just plain suck.",
        "I don't think you realise just how attractive you are. You're easily a 10, and that's coming from another 10, so I know what I'm talking about.",
        "I'm in a blah mood today, I can't make decisions, nothing sounds good, and I want to do something but I don't know what that is. So thanks for pretending I'm not being super difficult right now. I know I am, thanks for lying.",
        "Today I got myself into an existential crisis trying to think of how you'd explain the colour red to a blind person. That's when I realised that I shouldn't be left alone. Damn you.",
        "If we were robbing a bank together and the police caught me, I wouldn't tell them your name. Not even if they hurt my feelings.",
        "You think people ignore you like a Terms and Conditions box, however I will always accept you.",
        "I honestly don't know anyone like you. Except me. You're a lot like me. That's kinda cool",
        "Social occasions are like a game of tetris for me, and you're the well times long straight peice that clears away the clutter.",
        "I often wonder if anyone else thinks like me, and then I talk to you and I realise that we're both weird. I quite like that about you.",
        "I know the first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club, but you'd make me break that rule because you don't keep things from your best friend. Best friends first, then Fight Club.",
